# JoeyJR Batch Script Commands
These are Windows Batch Scripts,
You may use these to quickly switch modes without opening MODE.TXT and ctrl+S saving that way.

# Additional info:
These Scripts and README.md are currently in development.

I will be doing edits to work with the latest Firmware when the time comes.

Please no re-uploading, forking or mass sharing at the moment.

You may message suggestions to me on discord.
